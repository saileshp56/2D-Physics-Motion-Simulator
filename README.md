# 2D-Physics-Motion-Simulator
Using a text file, the program is given the mass, position, and velocity of 2 objects. It is then given the force placed on object 1, the force placed on object 2, and then the time that force is placed for. This program uses OOP to emulate the movement of each object. 
The output of the program is the distance between the two objects once all forces have been applied.
